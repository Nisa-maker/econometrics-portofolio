# Econometrics Portfolio

Welcome to my econometrics portfolio!  
This repository showcases applied econometrics projects, including regression analysis, time series forecasting, panel data models, and causal inference. Each project includes code, visualization, model diagnostics, and interpretation based on real economic questions.


##  Project Categories

###  1. Regression Analysis
Topics include:
- Multiple linear regression  
- Model diagnostics (heteroskedasticity, VIF, autocorrelation)  
- Interpretation of economic relationships  



###  2. Time Series Analysis
Methods:
- ARIMA / SARIMA  
- Trend & seasonal decomposition  
- Forecasting  



###  3. Panel Data Models
Using:
- Fixed Effects  
- Random Effects  
- Hausman test  

Applications such as minimum wage impact, regional development, and FDI analysis.



###  4. Causal Inference
Techniques:
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)  
- Instrumental Variables (IV / 2SLS)  
- Regression Discontinuity (RDD)  



##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Statsmodels  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  



##  Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates my skills in:
- Statistical and econometric modeling  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Empirical research  
- Translating results into economic insights  



✨ More projects coming soon. Stay tuned!
